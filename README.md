A series of sample Decorators for Azure Pipelines (Build and Release).

Decorators in this repo work only with Azure DevOps (_they are not available in Azure DevOps Server_).

Check the official documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-pipeline-decorator) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/pipeline-decorator-context) for more information about Azure Pipelines decorators.

## Intro to Decorators

I explain more about Pipelines Decorator in [my blog post here](https://dev.to/n3wt0n/azure-pipelines-decorators-all-you-need-to-know-72a)

If you want to have a step-by-step guide on how Decorators work and how to structure them, check out my video:

[![Pipelines Decorators on CoderDave](https://img.youtube.com/vi/1l-UAjdrSsM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l-UAjdrSsM)

In the video I actually reference this repo and its content.

## About this repo structure

There are 2 types of Basic Decorators in this repo:

- __Build__: The Decorators in this folder work with ___both___ the Classic Build pipelines and the Multistage (_YAML_) pipelines. 
  - When running in YAML pipelines, they are applied to ___both___ __Jobs__ and __Deployment Jobs__
- __Release__: The Decorators in this folder work ___only___ with the Classic Release pipelines.

In each of the previous folder, there are three other folders:
- __Pre__: this decorators run ___before___ any other task in the pipeline
- __Post__: this decorators run ___after___ any other task in the pipeline
- __PrePost__: this decorators run ___both before and after___ any other task in the pipeline

The __Advanced__ folder instead contains some different examples of slightly more advanced decorators, with specific implementations.

## Getting Started

To keep things simple, each folder contains a standalone decorator extension. 

Pick the one you want to use and follow the steps below.

For __prerequisites__ take a look [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/get-started/node?view=azure-devops#prerequisites)

### Build and Package the extension

First you need to install all the Node.js dependencies:

```cmd
npm install
```

Then you need to actually create the extension:

```cmd
tfx extension create --manifest-globs vss-extension.json
```

This will generate the _.vsix_ package file

> Remember to change the Publisher in the _vss-extension.json_ file with your publisher

### Publish the extension

When you have the extension file, head to [the marketplace management portal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage) and add the new extension.

You will also need to _share_ the extension to your organization.

> Only private extensions can contain Decorators, so be sure not to make it public.

For more info take a look at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/get-started/node?view=azure-devops#package-and-publish-your-extension

### Install the extension

Once shared with your Azure DevOps Organization, you can head to the _Manage Extensions_ tab under _Organization Settings_, go to _Shared_ and finally install your Decorato Extension.
